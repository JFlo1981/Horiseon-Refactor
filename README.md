# Horiseon-Refactor

Challenge 1 - Horiseon Refactor and code cleanup

This project included a starter code without any accessibility traits written into it.  
It also lacked efficient semantic structure in the .CSS file.  

My job on this project is to correct these errors and omissions to create a more user friendly web experience.

By using skills learned in the opening week of my coding boot camp, I will refactor this repository into a better version than i initially witnessed.
