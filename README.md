# Horiseon-Refactor

## Challenge 1:  Refactor the provided code from Horiseon.

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS

### This project included a starter code for HTML and CSS without accessibility traits and needed consolidation in the coding of the stylesheet.

My job on this project is to identify and correct these errors, omissions and oversites to create a more user and developer friendly web experience.

To do this, I refactored the code in sections and pushed my completed work to the repository including comments noting the changes with each commit.

One of the header links was not properly coded and this was resolved by adding href.

The main content of the body section was written without semantic elements, which created a confusing section of code and lacked accessiblity for the impaired.  This was corrected by adding common HTML semantic elements in place of the div soup.  In addition, several lines were designated as classes and I changed them to elements.

The stylesheet was strutured poorly. Some styles were missing to create a website in similar appearance to the provided mock-up.  It also lacked comments to help future coders identify sections of code. For this portion of the refactor I changed several lines to match the changes from class to element in the HTML page.  Comments were added to each section of rules with future developers in mind.  Several lines of code were consolidated to simplify the code and some sections were moved to be near like sections.
