# Horiseon-Refactor

## Challenge 1 - Horiseon Refactor and code cleanup:  

### This project included a starter code without any accessibility traits written into it.  It also lacked semantic elements and the style sheet was redundant.

My job on this project is to identify and correct these errors, omissions and oversites to create a more user and developer friendly web experience.

By using skills learned in the opening week of my coding boot camp, I will refactor this repository into a better version than I initially witnessed.
